    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Hopfield network is a classical model that helps us understand how memories are stored and retrieved in neural systems. It operates by associating stored patterns with stable fixed points; if a small error occurs, the system naturally corrects itself by converging back to the correct pattern.\n",
    "In this project, we will take the Hopfield model a step further. Instead of focusing on the stationary states, we will explore stable limit cycles where the neuronal states evolve over time following a sequence of patterns. You will be implementing this extension with minimal modifications to the classical model and investigate its ability to store and retrieve sequences of patterns. Further, you will also implement the cyclic Hopfield model as a continuous dynamical system, which will be compared to the discrete system and analysed using simple dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
    "Note: the project is intended to be solved using Python without the need for any specific library (other than the usual numpy and matplotlib). You are free to use other libraries if you want.\n",
    "At the bottom of the project you will find a list of resources and references for further reading."
